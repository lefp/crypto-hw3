The chat partners are a client and a server.
To run:
    `python3 server.py`
    `python3 client.py` (in a different terminal)   
        If the client and server are on the same machine, use `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` for the address prompt.
The server must be started before the client.

Use CTRL-C on any side to exit.
